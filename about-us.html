            <h2>Our Mission:</h2>
            <p>
                In our effort to combat social inequality we are striving to provide easier 
                access to literature for children. The “Little Library” system has often 
                partnered with local communities to provide smaller and more convenient library 
                locations but lacks the ability for finding informal book donation spots. Therefore, 
                our website focuses on a more grassroots approach, allowing people to register their 
                own book drop-off locations, fostering deeper community connections, and increasing 
                local literacy.
            </p>
